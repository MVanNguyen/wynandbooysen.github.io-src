Summary: Mikrotik WinBox for MacOS

Mikrotik's WinBox is a native Windows application used to manage and configure Mikrotik devices.

It is possible to run this under Wine on other operating systems.  Luckily for us Joshaven Potter builds a MacOS version with embedded Wine which you can download from his site <http://joshaven.com/resources/tools/winbox-for-mac/> and just drop into your applications directory and start using it immediately.

He also provides a MacOS version of Mikrotik's The Dude as well.
