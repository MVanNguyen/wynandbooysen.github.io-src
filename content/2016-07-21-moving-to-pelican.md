Summary: Moving to Pelican

This is my first post after switching to Pelican.

I decided that running a Virtual Private Server just to host WordPress was overkill, so I started looking at static site generators.

Ultimately ended up going with Pelican - Python based, mature and feature rich enough for what I need.

Now I only need to write more often :-)
